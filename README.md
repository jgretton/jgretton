# Hey, Iâ€™m Josh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UK-based web developer who builds things with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind. Most of my learning has come from real-world projects and figuring things out as I go.

Outside of coding, I coach volleyball, paint tiny Warhammer models, and occasionally try to keep a D&D campaign on track as a DM. Always up for learning something new (usually by breaking it first).
