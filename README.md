### Hello there.

<br>

I'm Josh, a self-taught web developer who builds things with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Most of my learning has come from real-world projects and figuring things out as I go.

I coach, referee, and play volleyball, paint tiny Warhammer models, and occasionally try to keep a D&D campaign on track as a DM.

#### Currently building and learning

- Diving into **Laravel** to expand my backend skills by developing a **Junior Development Programme** for my volleyball club.

#### Skills & Tech

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Currently learning Laravel
- Other: Git, REST APIs, Agile methodologies

Always open to chats about volleyball, dev, D&D, or anything in between.
