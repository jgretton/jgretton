### Hello there.

<br>


I'm Josh, a self-taught web developer who builds things with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Most of my learning has come from real-world projects and figuring things out as I go.  


 I coach volleyball, paint tiny Warhammer models, and occasionally try to keep a D&D campaign on track as a DM. Always up for learning something new (usually by breaking it first).  




####  Want to See More?

 You can check out my work at [joshgretton.co.uk](https://www.joshgretton.co.uk).  
 Or just scroll down and poke around the repos — most of them are things I’ve built, broken, and rebuilt.  
 Always open to chats about dev, D&D, or anything in between.
